// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.


let guests = [
    "ali",
    "hassan",
    "taha"
]

for (let guest of guests){
    console.log("hello " + guest + " join us on dinner")
}
export default guests;
